# hello-world-2

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? 
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. I'm just a poor boy.
I need no sympathy. Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me.
